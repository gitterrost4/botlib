**THE ADMINS ON THIS SERVER ARE NOT DEVELOPERS. DEVELOPERS ARE MARKED WITH A DARK RED NAME AND TAG.**

-Rules-

1. Absolutely zero NSFW content (pornography, excessive violence, etc) is to be shared here. Don't spoil it for everyone else.

2. No self promotion except in channels where allowed. If you're unsure if it's allowed, it probably isn't. For example, if you start streaming you may post that you have begun in the #community-content channel.

3. If you have a problem use @Moderator to ping someone for assistance. Avoid unecessary usage of this ping or other moderator pings such as @Admin. Please do not privately message the moderators unless it is a serious matter. Game questions are not a serious matter and are why the #questions channel exists. This includes name pings.

4. For game-related questions, please ask in the #questions channel. You may tag @Mentor at all times for those questions. These are members that we deem very experienced, friendly and helpful and they have volunteered to help other players.

5. Please do not tag the developers. They are here to be a part of the community. While they may come across your suggestions and ideas here, the best way to contact them is through their feedback email at taptapheroes.feedback@gmail.com.

6. **Be generally nice to the other members.**

To gain access to the server please react to the message in the #welcome channel with :robot: if you play on Android and :apple: if you play on iOS.

Provide an admin with a screenshot of the guild tab if you manage an active guild and we'll give you a special role!

Tips:

You can use `tap.suggest` in the #game-suggestions channel to let other people vote on suggestions you have for the game. Please look in #suggestion-vote if your suggestion already has been suggested.
